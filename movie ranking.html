<h1>The Best Movies According To Kelson</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>John Q</h3>
<p>An emotional, heart-wrenching story that not only takes viewers on a journey within their own souls, but also opens up their eyes to the way the health care system works.</p>
<h3>Black Panther</h3>
<p>Firstly, the film features a predominantly Black cast and crew, which was groundbreaking for a major superhero blockbuster. This representation was celebrated as an important step towards more diverse and inclusive storytelling in Hollywood.</p>
<p>The Afrofuturistic world of Wakanda, the fictional African nation that is home to the Black Panther, was also praised for its richly imagined culture, technology, and social structure. This provided a refreshing alternative to common Western depictions of Africa.</p>
<p>Finally, the film's stunning visual design, rousing musical score (featuring artists from the West Coast like Kendrick Lamar, Mozzy, and SOBxRBE), and well-choreographed action sequences contributed to an immersive and entertaining cinematic experience that audiences responded to positively.</p>
<h3>Nightcrawler</h3>
<p>Thanks to Gyllenhaal's quirky and unhinged performance, this is a volatile ride worth taking. Fresh score. A pulse-pounding thriller set on the streets of Los Angeles, Nightcrawler stars a phenomenal Jake Gyllenhaal as a man who rises to fame by recording violent events in the middle of the night.</p>
